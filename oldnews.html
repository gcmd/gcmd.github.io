<h3>0.9.10 Released - Feb 24 2003</h3>
<p>The 0.9.10 tarball is now available. Notice that Savannah has some bug in the file area that makes this release appear in the end of the list and not at the top. Here is a <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/gcmd/gcmd.pkg/0.9.10/gnome-commander-0.9.10.tar.gz">direct link</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of user visible changes in this version:</p>

<p>Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an imageloading bug when using themes other than the default one.
<li>New bookmark feature.
<li>New template feature in the advanced-rename dialog. See doc/advrename.txt in the tarball for details.
<li>Nicer file-properties dialog with rename support.
<li>Dragging files to the ".." directory is now possible.
<li>The toolbar and buttonbar can now be hidden.
</ul>


<h3>0.9.9 Released - Jan 19 2003</h3>
<p>There are not so many new features in this version. On the other hand 
there are lots of improvements all over the program so the old features are 
now a lot more useable than they used to be.</p>

<p>Some highlights from the ChangeLog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the advanced rename tool</li>
<li>Added quick connect feature.</li>
<li>Improved search dialog and fixed some bugs in it.</li>
<li>Added default low-res mime icon theme.</li>
<li>Made the file popup menu behave more normal.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bad directory name in 0.9.8 release - Jul 17 2002</h3> 
<p>If you downloaded the 0.9.8 release as source, you may have noticed that 
the directory name in the tarball was wrong. That has been fixed now, but there 
is no need to download again since the directory name is all that has been changed.</p>

<h3>0.9.8 Released - Jul 16 2002</h3>
<p>New things in this release are autoscroll at DND, better quicksearch, mounting 
and unmounting, file lists refresh without FAM, last visited directory history and more.</p>

<h3>0.9.7 problems - Jun 7 2002</h3>
<p>Many people seems to have had problems building the 0.9.7 release. If you are
one of thoose you should try the new tarball at SF which solves some of the
problems at least.</p>

<h3>0.9.7 Released - Jun 6 2002</h3>
<p>Since this is the swedish national day I decided that all the other folks out
there should have something to celebrate too. So here is a brand new release to
get excited about.</p>

<h3>0.9.6 Released - Apr 4 2002</h3>  
<p>MIME support has been added and bugs have been fixed.</p> 
 
<h3>0.9.5 Released - Mar 27 2002</h3>

<h3>0.9.3 Released - Mar 10 2002</h3> 
<p>A couple of more bug fixes.</p> 
 
<h3>0.9.2 Released - Mar 9 2002</h3>
<p>Improved stability and less memory leaks. CVS disabled until it actually works well.</p> 
 
<h3>0.91-pre1 Released - Feb 6 2002</h3>
<p>Improved userinterface and lots of other small hacks. If you're confused by the version numbers, it's all my fault.</p>

<p>This is the first public version of GNOME commander. Bugreports and feedback is wanted at <i>marbj499 at student.liu.se</i></p>
