<h4 class="nh4">GCMD goes C++ - Feb. 26 2007</h4>
<p>The Gnome Commander code has now begun a migration from C to C++. Both the HEAD and 1.3 devel branch are 
now initially migrated and seemes to be working quite allright. Seen from a user perspective this migration 
is not supposed to change anything, the change is done due to coding reasons. Tests and bugreports on the 
GCMD SVN code are of course, as usual, much appreciated.  Further info on how to download the source from SVN
can be found on our <a href="dev.html">Development page</a>, but remember that this unreleased SVN code is 
to be considered unstable and only for testing purposes.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">GCMD in Fedora - Jan. 03 2007</h4>
<p>Gnome Commander has now found its way into the Fedora "Extras" repositry.  
Users of Fedora 5 and 6 has now got convienient official binary Fedora packages to install from, 
available for the architechtures i386, x86_64 and ppc. The authors of Gnome Commander thanks the 
team behind Fedora, and wish them a happy 2007.</p>

as rpm's will bee added at the gcmd Savannah archive.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.12 Released - Mar 18 2003</h4>
<p>Bugfixes.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">Feedback++ - Mar 13 2003</h4>
<p>We're getting close to v1.0 so make sure to report all problems with the 0.9.11 release to the mailinglist. A common problem if running RedHat8 or Mandrake8.2 is instabilities in the search-dialog. See section 6 in the <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/gcmd/gnome-commander/README?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/plain">README</a> for info on how to deal with that.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.11 Released - Mar 13 2003</h4>
<p>Not so much big news this time but some annoying bugs were fixed</p>
<p>Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for $p in advrename dialog. This will give you the parent directory.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where deleting a directory sometimes only emptied the directory but not delete it.</li>
<li>Fixed so that the ".." directory is visible in ftp-sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="nh4">Important 0.9.10 information - Feb 25 2003</h4>
<p>If you have lots of ftp-servers stored in your <i>~/.gnome-commander/ftp-servers</i> file you should make a backup of that file before upgrading, otherwise they will be lost since the format of that file has changed in this version.</p>
<p>Since the file is stored as text the motivated user should find it quite easy to convert to the new format in any text editor.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.10 Released - Feb 24 2003</h4>
<p>The 0.9.10 tarball is now available. Notice that Savannah has some bug in the file area that makes this release appear in the end of the list and not at the top.</p>
<p>Lots of user visible changes in this version:</p>

<p>Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an imageloading bug when using themes other than the default one.
<li>New bookmark feature.
<li>New template feature in the advanced-rename dialog. See doc/advrename.txt in the tarball for details.
<li>Nicer file-properties dialog with rename support.
<li>Dragging files to the ".." directory is now possible.
<li>The toolbar and buttonbar can now be hidden.
</ul>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.9 Released - Jan 19 2003</h4>
<p>There are not so many new features in this version. On the other hand 
there are lots of improvements all over the program so the old features are 
now a lot more useable than they used to be.</p>

<p>Some highlights from the ChangeLog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the advanced rename tool</li>
<li>Added quick connect feature.</li>
<li>Improved search dialog and fixed some bugs in it.</li>
<li>Added default low-res mime icon theme.</li>
<li>Made the file popup menu behave more normal.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="nh4">Bad directory name in 0.9.8 release - Jul 17 2002</h4> 
<p>If you downloaded the 0.9.8 release as source, you may have noticed that 
the directory name in the tarball was wrong. That has been fixed now, but there 
is no need to download again since the directory name is all that has been changed.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.8 Released - Jul 16 2002</h4>
<p>New things in this release are autoscroll at DND, better quicksearch, mounting 
and unmounting, file lists refresh without FAM, last visited directory history and more.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.7 problems - Jun 7 2002</h4>
<p>Many people seems to have had problems building the 0.9.7 release. If you are
one of thoose you should try the new tarball at SF which solves some of the
problems at least.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.7 Released - Jun 6 2002</h4>
<p>Since this is the swedish national day I decided that all the other folks out
there should have something to celebrate too. So here is a brand new release to
get excited about.</p>

<h4 class="nh4">0.9.6 Released - Apr 4 2002</h4>  
<p>MIME support has been added and bugs have been fixed.</p> 
 
<h4 class="nh4">0.9.5 Released - Mar 27 2002</h4>
<p>Added an embedded terminal and fixed some bugs.</p> 
 
<h4 class="nh4">0.9.4 Released - Mar 21 2002</h4>  
<p>Added FAM support, DnD and more.</p> 
 
<h4 class="nh4">0.9.3 Released - Mar 10 2002</h4> 
<p>A couple of more bug fixes.</p> 
 
<h4 class="nh4">0.9.2 Released - Mar 9 2002</h4>
<p>Improved stability and less memory leaks. CVS disabled until it actually works well.</p> 
 
<h4 class="nh4">0.91-pre1 Released - Feb 6 2002</h4>
<p>Improved userinterface and lots of other small hacks. If you're confused by the version numbers, it's all my fault.</p> 
 
<h4 class="nh4">0.90-pre1 Released - Aug 2 2001</h4>
<p>This is the first public version of GNOME commander. Bugreports and feedback is wanted at <i>marbj499 at student.liu.se</i></p>
