<h3>0.9.9 Released - Jan 19 2003</h3>
<p> There are not so many new features
in this version. On the other hand there are lots of improvements all over
the program so the old features are now a lot mure useable than they used
to be.</p>

<ul>

<h3>Bad directory name in 0.9.8 release - Jul 17 2002</h3> 
<p>If you downloaded the 0.9.8 release as source, you may have noticed that 
the directory name in the tarball was wrong. That has been fixed now, but there 
is no need to download again since the directory name is all that has been changed.</p>

<p>New things in this release are autoscroll at DND, better quicksearch, mounting 
and unmounting, file lists refresh without FAM, last visited directory history and more.</p>

<h3>0.9.7 problems - Jun 7 2002</h3>
<p>Many people seems to have had problems building the 0.9.7 release. If you are
one of thoose you should try the new tarball at SF which solves some of the
problems at least.</p>

<h3>0.9.7 Released - Jun 6 2002</h3>
