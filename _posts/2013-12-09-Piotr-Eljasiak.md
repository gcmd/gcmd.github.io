It is very sad for us to announce that Piotr Eljasiak, the project
manager and main developer of GNOME Commander [passed
away](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/gcmd-devel/2013-04/msg00000.html)
in the beginning of 2012. Without him GNOME Commander would not be what
it is today.

Piotr took over the project from Marcus Bjurman in 2006 together with
Assaf Gordon at version 1.1.6. Until version 1.2.8.15, Piotr implemented
many new features and pushed it to one of the best graphical two pane
file managers in the Linux environment.

Piotr had many ideas about the future of GNOME Commander. Some of them
are already implemented and are waiting to be released in version 1.4.
We are convinced that Piotr would like to see his work go on.
