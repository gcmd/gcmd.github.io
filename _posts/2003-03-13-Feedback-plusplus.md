We're getting close to v1.0 so make sure to report all problems with the
0.9.11 release to the mailinglist. A common problem if running RedHat8
or Mandrake8.2 is instabilities in the search-dialog. See section 6 in
the
[README](http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/gcmd/gnome-commander/README?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/plain)
for info on how to deal with that.
