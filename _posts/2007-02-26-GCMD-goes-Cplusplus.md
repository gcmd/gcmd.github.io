The Gnome Commander code has now begun a migration from C to C++. Both
the HEAD and 1.3 devel branch are now initially migrated and seems to
be working quite allright. Seen from a user perspective this migration
is not supposed to change anything, the change is done due to coding
reasons.

Tests and bugreports on the GCMD SVN code are of course, as usual, much
appreciated. Further info on how to download the source from SVN can be
found on our [Development page](/dev.html), but remember that
this unreleased SVN code is to be considered unstable and only for
testing purposes.
