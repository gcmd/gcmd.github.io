The Gnome Commander team is happy to announce the release of Gnome
Commander version **1.18.1**.

Two weeks after the last release, we anounce this small bugfix release
which fixes a crash when starting Gnome Commander. Also two translations
were added.

Thanks for Mamoru Tasaka who reported the bug and created a
proofe-of-concept for a fix. As always, thanks go out to the
translators, as well!

Happy commanding!
