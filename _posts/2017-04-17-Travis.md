title: 'Gnome Commander built on Travis'
excerpt: ''
---

Gnome Commander is now continuously integrated in Travis. I configured
the service file to have Gnome Commander build inside a Ubuntu 17.04
Container for each Git commit in the master, gcmd-1-4 and gcmd-1-6
branch.

See here for the latest build history:
[https://travis-ci.org/gcmd/gnome-commander](https://travis-ci.org/gcmd/gnome-commander).

The build badge is shown on the Gcmd homepage:
