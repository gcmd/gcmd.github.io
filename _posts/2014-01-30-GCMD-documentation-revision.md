The release of GCMD v1.4.0 is gradually approaching. Currently, the
offline documentation is beeing completely revised. Many new features of
the current development version haven't been documented yet. It is
planned that string fixation will be in mid of February.

After this deadline, the translation teams of GNOME can start to
contribute so we may welcome GCMD v1.4.0 already in March. Stay tuned!
