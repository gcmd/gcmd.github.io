### Details ###

#### Configurable 'Send files' command ####

The 'Send files' command is now configurable in the Programs tab of the
Gnome Commander options. The default value is set to `nautilus-sendto
%s`.

![Options_send_to](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_send_to.png){: .center-image }

Personally, I like to send my mail via mutt, so my preferred
send-to command is<br> `gnome-terminal -e "mutt -a %s"`. Have fun to add
your own cool command.

#### Copy path name from directory indicator ####

When you right click on a part of the directory indicator, the path up
to the position of the mouse cursor is copied. 

![Copy_from_dir_indicator](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_dir_indicator.png){: .center-image }

In the example above, `/home/uwe/Programmieren/Projekte` can be pasted
from the clipboard after right-clicking.

#### Show/hide mainmenu ####

The user action 'Display main menu' is a now available at the
Settings->Keyboard Shortcuts tab:

![show_hide_mainmenu](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_display_main_menu.png){: .center-image }

In the example above, the shortcut has been set to `F12`. Initially,
there is no shortcut allocated with this action. So chose one by
yourself to use this feature. And have even more space for your file
panes available, yeah!

#### Simple plug-in system for file context menu ####

Now you can extend the file context menu even more easily then before.
Here is an example with four additional entries:

![Simple_plugin_system](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_context_menu.png){: .center-image }

How does it work?

  - Create the directory `~/.gnome-commander/scripts/`

  - Create a script file here with an arbitrary name. A simple example:<br><br>
    `#!/bin/sh`<br>
    `#name: Make tar gz`<br>
    `tar -cf archive.tar.gz $@ -z`<br>

 - Save it and open the file context menu in GCMD. 'Make tar gz' is a new entry now.
 - Each script can have the following properties, defined in the script header:
   - `name` - the name of the menu item. If not set, use the filename of the script.
   - `term` - run the script in a terminal window if set to `true`.
 - Property format: `#[property]: [value]`
 - If you press the Shift key, the script will be called for each selected file separately. Otherwise, the list of files will be transmitted to the script as a list of arguments.
 - Sample scripts can be found [here](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-commander/tree/gcmd-scripts)

#### Usage of strftime patterns in the File Roller plugin ####

In the configuration dialog of the File Roller plugin it is possible now to
set a global filename prefix pattern for newly created archives. Replacement of
`strftime` strings is supported, which is convenient when you periodically
create archives and want their filenames to contain the current date.
In the figure below a screenshot of the File Roller plugin options
is shown with an example of the current year, month and date in the filename.

![dconf_editor](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_file_roller_plugin.png){: .center-image }

Patterns from `strftime` always begin with a percent sign and will be replaced by the plugin
when creating a new archive. The string `$N` will be replaced by the name of the original
file or folder to be archived. All other characters will remain.

#### Usage of dconf instead of gnome-config ####

Most program options have been stored at `~/.gnome2/gnome-commander` and
`~/.gnome2/gnome-commander-size` in the past. For doing so the outdated
'gnome-config' library was used.

When you boot GCMD v1.6.0 the first time now, all the settings in these
files are automatically transfered into your local dconf database, the
configuration system of GNOME 3. The config files in `~/.gnome2/` are
then renamed to `~/.gnome2/xxx.deprecated`. You can delete them safely
when you feel everything went fine.

All GCMD options can be graphically displayed and set in the
dconf-editor (see the image below) at the path
`org.gnome.gnome-commander`. Changing a setting there will have
immediate effect in a running GCMD session for most of these options. Of
course, changing settings from inside GCMD will still work.

![dconf_editor](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_dconf_editor.png){: .center-image }

There exists also an xml-config file in
`~/.gnome-commander/gnome-commander.xml`. Options stored there are not
affected by the update in any way.


#### Usage of gkeyfile for devices and favourite apps ####

When GCMD v1.6.0 is started the first time, all favourite applications
and all devices stored in `~/.gnome-commander/fav-apps` and
`~/.gnome-commander/devices` created in previous GCMD versions are
converted into a key-value format using GKeyFile. This file format is
much more human readable compared to the self-made format in previous
versions. Backup files are copied to
`~/.gnome-commander/fav-apps.deprecated` and
`~/.gnome-commander/devices.deprecated`. These files can be deleted
later on.
