This project has been unmaintained for quite some time, two years since
last release, but it is not unmaintained anymore. Piotr Eljasiak has
agreed to maintain and keep on developing this project. One more
developer, Assaf Gordon has also joined the project and recently
submitted some new code and patches. So, this project is alive again and
the work for next release 1.1.7 has begun = more news to come...
