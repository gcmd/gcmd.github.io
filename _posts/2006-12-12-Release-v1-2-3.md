Fastest new release so far ... This is a bug fix to the problem
introduced in the yesterday release 1.2.2. Please upgrade to this latest
one where this bug [384752 - Permissions for new
dirs](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384752) is fixed (we
hope that not too many of you had time to upgrade to 1.2.2, sorry for
the inconvenience).
