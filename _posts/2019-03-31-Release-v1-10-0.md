The Gnome Commander team is proud to announce the release of Gnome
Commander **v1.10.0**. The new version comes with a number of new
features and bugfixes after over 200 commits since v1.8.1. Most of the
changes are of technical nature. You will not notice big changes on your
daily work with Gnome Commander.

As the maintainer I would like to thank all the people who contributed
to this release. A big 'Thank you!' goes also to the translators from
the [Gnome translation teams](https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/). You did a
great job in the past weeks!

Below you will find a list of all changes and a closer look at the
migration of the Gnome Commander settings.

### Details to to complete move of Settings into GSettings ###

The work which has been started in version 1.6.0 to migrate the programm
settings into GSettings has been finished. The program settings from
`~/.gnome-commander/` are migrated smoothly and transparent into the
dconf database when you start Gnome Commander 1.10 the first time. The
config files are then renamed to something like `xxx.deprecated`. You
can safely delete them when you feel everything works fine.

Furthermore, the config folder itself is now moved into
`.config/gnome-commander` to be inline with modern Linux desktop
guidelines. Inside of this folder, there are still two subfolders for
scripts and plugins used by Gnome Commander.

All Gnome Commander settings can be graphically displayed and set in the
dconf-editor (see the image below) at the path
`org.gnome.gnome-commander`.

![dconf_editor](/ss/Release_v1.6.0_dconf_editor.png){: .center-image }

It is planed to throw away the gnome-config library completely in the
next bugfix release of Gnome Commander which is now only used for the
migration of the settings above. Later on we don't need this library
anymore.
