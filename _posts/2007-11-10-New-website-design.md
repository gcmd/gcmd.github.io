A major update to this homepage. The website has had the same look since
2004 and we had grown a little tired of it. We hope you like our new
face to the world, though most of the content are the same as before,
just some updated screenshots.

As for the program itself, development goes on, 90-something changes in
[the
changelog](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-commander/blob/master/ChangeLog-20090629)
since the release of version 1.2.4. We do not have a timetable for the
next release, but it is getting closer as the code matures and some more
glitches are beeing worked out.
