title: 'New Release: v1.14.0'
excerpt: ''
---

The Gnome Commander team is happy to release version **1.14.0** today.
Amongst many changes, this version comes with the long awaited
migration away from GnomeVFS to GIO. This made it possible to close
a number of open issues which all have been depending on this migration.
The oldest issue, the use of the desktop trash can, was waiting 15 years
for completion...

You may ask why it took so long? Well... there have been some things to
investigate before. As a file manager, Gnome Commander depended
heavily on GnomeVFS. So I first had to understand how GnomeVFS works and
how it was used in Gnome Commander. Then I had to understand what the
difference to GIO was, how it worked and how it could be used in
Gnome Commander instead. And after that was solved it was surprisingly
easy. ... If you don't count the evenings of pondering and guessing in
front of the keyboard, haha. And of course in the meantime I also worked
on many non-GIO related issues.

I want to thank the people who contributed to this release. First of
all, it is my wife who is using Gnome Commander nearly daily and she is
the one who you should say thanks to in the end. Why? Because the Gnome
Commander project took a reasonable part of our quality time and if she
would not have motivated me, Gnome Commander would not be what it is now. ^_^
And then there is again the long list of contributors, bug reporters, translators and
people who discussed things on the mailing lists. Thanks go out to you!

As this is the first release after the GIO migration, there might be still
some issues which I did not face yet. If you encounter one, please feel free
to open a issue ticket at
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-commander/issues" title="Please report bugs here">gitlab.gnome.org</a>.

Finally one note for you: Remember that on February 14th the Free Software
Foundation is celebrating the
"[I love free Software Day](https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/)".
A simple "Thank you" to the open source project you are using regularly is sooo much
appreciated. ^_^

### Details ###

Below are some detailed descriptions what has changed in this release.

#### Select a default Drag-And-Drop Action ####

Go to "Settings -> Options -> Confirmation -> Default Drag and Drop Action"

When the first option is selected, dropping files with the mouse from
one folder to another opens a popup menu as in previous versions. New
are the two selectable default options. When one of them is selected,
the associated operation will be performed without opening a popup.

#### Use of the deskop trash can ####

By default, deleted files and folders will now be moved into the trash can
instead of physically deleting them forever. This behaviour can be changed
in "Settings -> Options -> General"

#### Removed internal file search dialog ####

For release 1.14.0 it was decided to remove the internal search dialog
(opened through F9). Instead, you can now provide an external command
for searching files (e.g. <code>catfish</code> or <code>recoll</code>).
The reason for this decission was that the internal search dialog was
hard to migrate over to GIO. On the other hand, there are already good
search tools available.

#### Name of connected remote server ####

If you are connected to a remote server, the name of the host is now
shown in the directory indicator like this:
