There are not so many new features in this version. On the other hand 
there are lots of improvements all over the program so the old features are 
now a lot more useable than they used to be.

#### Some highlights from the ChangeLog:

* Improved the advanced rename tool
* Added quick connect feature.
* Improved search dialog and fixed some bugs in it.
* Added default low-res mime icon theme.
* Made the file popup menu behave more normal.
