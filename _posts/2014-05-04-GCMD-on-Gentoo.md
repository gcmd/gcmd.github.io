### Gnome Commander on Gentoo

Since yesterday GCMD is available in the official Gentoo [portage
tree](http://packages.gentoo.org/package/gnome-extra/gnome-commander
"GNOME Commander in portage"). Thanks go to the Gentoo developer Markos
Chandras and Markus Rathgeb who helped us reaching this goal. For the
interested ones, have a look at the Gentoo Bugzilla entry
[#231885](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231885).

*[GCMD]: Gnome Commander
