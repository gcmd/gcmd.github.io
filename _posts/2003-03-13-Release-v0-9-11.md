Not so much big news this time but some annoying bugs were fixed.

#### Highlights

* Added support for `$p` in advrename dialog. This will give you the parent directory.
* Fixed a bug where deleting a directory sometimes only emptied the directory but not delete it.
* Fixed so that the ".." directory is visible in ftp-sessions.
