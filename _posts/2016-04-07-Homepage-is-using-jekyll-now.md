Do you know [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? This tool is great for
generating static web pages out of plain text files.

In the last days I spend some time to convert all posts which have been
written for the GCMD home page to single markdown files. They are stored
in a dedicated "_posts" folder. After pushing the changes to the
[repository](https://github.com/gcmd/gcmd.github.io) at GitHub, jekyll
converts all the blog posts into HTML, roughly spoken.

I did this as it will be much more fun now and also take much less time
to create new posts here.
