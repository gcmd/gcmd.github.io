##### Update Dec 08

Problem solved!

Piotr has now closed bug
[bgo#349631](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=349631) for
v1.2.1 and the work in the 1.2.2 release can continue as planned. Thanks
to the feedback on this issue.

Unfortunately we have to delay the launch of the planned 1.2.2 release.
There is still a very irritating bug concerning SMB networks, which we
have a hard time to pinpoint, so we need some quality bugreports and
feedback on this. Our bugzilla is now stormed by mostly ubuntu users
reporting gcmd [crash when SMB
browsing](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=349631). Any help
will be very welcome, since we cannot reproduce this bug.

Please contact us on
[gcmd-devel@nongnu.org](mailto:gcmd-devel@nongnu.org?Subject=The
SMB-bug) ([our developer mailing list info
page](http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-devel "The page from
wich you can sign up on our developer mailing list")) if you are
experiencing this bug and want to help us with info to track this down.
