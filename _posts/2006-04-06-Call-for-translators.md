#### A message to all native speakers of non-English languages

As we are getting closer to the release of GNOME Commander 1.2.0, we need updated translations 
before the release that is planned to happen around mid April.

If you'd like to contribute a translation, please read [the guide on the
development page](/dev.html#trnsl) to see how to do a translation. All
contributors are very welcome and will get the gratitude of GNOME
Commander users world wide!
