If you have lots of ftp-servers stored in your
_~/.gnome-commander/ftp-servers_ file you should make a backup of that
file before upgrading, otherwise they will be lost since the format of
that file has changed in this version.

Since the file is stored as text the motivated user should find it quite
easy to convert to the new format in any text editor.
