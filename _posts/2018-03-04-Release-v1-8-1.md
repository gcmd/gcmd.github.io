title: 'New Release: v1.8.1'
excerpt: ''
---

Although this is a bugfix release there are two small new features
coming with 1.8.1. The third change, which is not really a new feature,
is: Python support has been dropped from Gnome Commander with this
release. One of the closed bugs is of interest for you if you are using
the simple plugin system, which has been introduced in version 1.6.0.

And another hint for you:
[here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-commander/-/tree/master/gcmd-scripts)
you can find some little sample scripts you can use as a starter for the
simple plugin system. Just copy the scripts into
`~/.gnome-commander/scripts/` and see the result when you right-click on
a file name in one of Gnome Commanders file panes.
