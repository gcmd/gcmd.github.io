The [mailinglists](/index.html#maillists) are up and working again.

For a long time the only mails coming of the lists have been spam, but
now the lists are being moderated again since the new project management
gained admin access to them. All posts from non members of the lists are
now being held for approval, this will stop spam effectively. Tough
anyone is welcome to sign up on the lists.
