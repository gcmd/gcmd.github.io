<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>Most multimedia formats can contain different kinds of metadata describing the subject matter and some technical data about the 
content of the file. From version 1.2.1, Gnome Commander has some ability to handle different kinds of metadata embedded in files. 
This page lists all tags supported with descriptions of the tags, and some descriptions on how and where to make use of it..</p>

<h3>Howto use..</h3>
<h4>In the advanced rename tool</h4>
<p>Metadata tags can be used as templates in the advanced renaming tool with the <code>$T(Tag.Code)</code> placeholder. 
As an example: Mark a couple of jpeg files from a digital camera, chose the renaming tool and write <code>$T(Exif.DateTime)</code> 
as Template in the inputbox at top, then it will replace the filenames in marked files with the date and time the photography was taken 
(Exif is commonly used by digital cameras).</p>

The Interoperability copyright statement including date and rights should be written in this field; e.g., "Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights reserved.". The field records both the photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright, separated by NULL (in this case, since the statement also ends with a NULL, there are two NULL codes) (see example 1). When only the photographer is given, it is terminated by one NULL code. When only the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then the editor copyright is given. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.</td></tr>

The only relational information recorded here is the Exif audio file name and extension (an ASCII string consisting of 8 characters + '.' + 3 characters). The path is not recorded. When using this tag, audio files must be recorded in conformance to the Exif audio format. Writers are also allowed to store the data such as Audio within APP2 as FlashPix extension stream data. Audio files must be recorded in conformance to the Exif audio format. If multiple files are mapped to one file, the above format is used to record just one audio file name. If there are multiple audio files, the first recorded file is given. When there are three Exif audio files "SND00001.WAV", "SND00002.WAV" and "SND00003.WAV", the Exif image file name for each of them, "DSC00001.JPG", is indicated. By combining multiple relational information, a variety of playback possibilities can be supported. The method of using relational information is left to the implementation on the playback side. Since this information is an ASCII character string, it is terminated by NULL. When this tag is used to map audio files, the relation of the audio file to image data must also be indicated on the audio file end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exif.ResolutionUnit</td><td>Resolution Unit</td><td>The unit for measuring "Exif.XResolution" and "Exif.YResolution". The same unit is used for both "Exif.XResolution" and "Exif.YResolution". If the image resolution is unknown, 2 (inches) is designated.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Exif.UserComment</td><td>User Comment</td><td>A tag for Exif users to write keywords or comments on the image besides those in "Exif.ImageDescription", and without the character code limitations of the "Exif.ImageDescription" tag. The character code used in the "Exif.UserComment" tag is identified based on an ID code in a fixed 8-byte area at the start of the tag data area. The unused portion of the area is padded with NULL ("00.h"). ID codes are assigned by means of registration. The value of CountN is determinated based on the 8 bytes in the character code area and the number of bytes in the user comment part. Since the TYPE is not ASCII, NULL termination is not necessary. The ID code for the "Exif.UserComment" area may be a Defined code such as JIS or ASCII, or may be Undefined. The Undefined name is UndefinedText, and the ID code is filled with 8 bytes of all "NULL" ("00.H"). An Exif reader that reads the "Exif.UserComment" tag must have a function for determining the ID code. This function is not required in Exif readers that do not use the "Exif.UserComment" tag. When a "Exif.UserComment" area is set aside, it is recommended that the ID code be ASCII and that the following user comment part be filled with blank characters [20.H].</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exif.WhiteBalance</td><td>White Balance</td><td>The white balance mode set when the image was shot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exif.WhitePoint</td><td>White Point</td><td>The chromaticity of the white point of the image. Normally this tag is not necessary, since color space is specified in "Exif.ColorSpace" tag.</td></tr>

No default is given in TIFF; but here "Color Space Guidelines" is used as the default. The color space is declared in a color space information tag, with the default being the value that gives the optimal image characteristics Interoperability this condition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exif.YCbCrPositioning</td><td>YCbCr Positioning</td><td>The position of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. This field is designated only for JPEG compressed data or uncompressed YCbCr data. The TIFF default is 1 (centered); but when Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:2 it is recommended in this standard that 2 (co-sited) be used to record data, in order to improve the image quality when viewed on TV systems. When this field does not exist, the reader shall assume the TIFF default. In the case of Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:0, the TIFF default (centered) is recommended. If the reader does not have the capability of supporting both kinds of "Exif.YCbCrPositioning", it shall follow the TIFF default regardless of the value in this field. It is preferable that readers be able to support both centered and co-sited positioning.</td></tr>
