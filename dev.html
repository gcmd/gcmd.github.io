<p>This page contains information about hacking and contributing to the Gnome Commander project. 
We encourage anyone hwo wants to contribute with code, translations, bugreporting, boil up 
new useful ideas, or just give some quality feedback that also is quite important. You are all welcome to 
sign up on our mailing lists and take part in discussions and development.</p>

<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>Some words about versions and version numbering.</p>
<p>Gnome Commander is being developed in a 
stable and a testing branch, where the test releases fills the purpose of testing new ideas. Successful ones 
will then get backported to the stable branch. The version numbers (major, minor and micro) follows the quite 
usual standard of odd and even versioning, where odd minor versions stands for the unstable releases and 
the even numbered branch eventually gets the thoroughly tested new functions backported. Remember this 
when talking about GCMD or when sending patches.</p>

<h2><a name="contr">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>If you want to contribute, send in patches, translations, having some useful idea or just some feedback, 
good or bad, then you are welcome to contact us thrugh <a href="#maillists">our mailing lists</a> or 
<a href="#authors">the authors</a> directly if you want to keep it more private.</p>
<p>If you're not an programmer but have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program, check the 
<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/TODO">TODO file</a> first before sending  
<a href="index.html#authors">email to the authors</a> or <a href="#maillists">the mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to submit a patch please do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email with the patch to the developers or the developer list.</li>
<li>Please use the -u flag when generating a patch.</li>
<li>Include it as text together with a good explanation of what the patch does or what problem/bug it solves.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Special note for translators:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Send translations as gzipped or bzipped attachments to avoid losing language specific characters.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="doc">Hacking documents</a></h2>
<p>Links to documents regarding Gnome Commander internals.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/doc/internal_viewer_hacking.txt">Internal-Viewer Internals</a>. 
This document describes details of the 'libgviewer' library, which implements GnomeCommander's Internal-Viewer. 
If you plan to hack the internal viewer, add features or just browse the source for fun, we recommend reading 
this document first (However note that <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-commander/">the source files in CVS</a> 
always are more updated than this document).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
<h3>Discovered a bug?</h3>
<p>You can report or view Gnome Commander bugs at 
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-commander" title="Please report bugs here">the 
gnome.org Bugzilla</a>.</p>

<p>Though Gnome Commander is relatively free from bugs and a quite mature program, no programs will 
ever be totally bugfree. New bugs can be introduced with new features or through other programs and 
libraries it depends on, this goes especially for development and testing versions. Good bugreporting 
is very important and can be a very good help for the developers to make a better program. Bugreporting 
is not an act of dissatisfaction, so you are very welcome to help us hunt down and kill the bugs. 
Testing of new releases and bugreporting is the best way users without programming knowledge can help 
out in the development of a program, and those with programming knowledge are welcome to suggest fixes 
and/or send patches to the developers, all in the spirit of free and open source software.</p>

<h2><a name="maillists">Mailing lists</a></h2>
<p>There are two mailing lists regarding Gnome Commander.</p> 
<p>The user list is mostly for topics about using Gnome Commander, a kind of support list. 
The devel list is where the developers of this project are discussing topics about the development. 
For the moment, all posts from non members of these lists are beeing held for approval due to 
spam reasons, but anyone are welcome to sign up on the lists and post unmoderated. So, if you 
post without beeing signed up on the list, your mail will be moderated before it is sent to the list,

<li>The developer list: <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-devel">gcmd-devel</a> (gcmd-devel at nongnu.org)</li>
</ul> 

<h2><a name="team">The team</a></h2>

<h3>Contributors</h3>
<p>There are many small contributors that has contributed in many ways, it would be impossible to

<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/AUTHORS">AUTHORS file</a> or the 
<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/po/ChangeLog">changelog of translations</a>.</p>

<p>A big "thanks to" is also directed to the former maintainer of Gnome Commander, Marcus Bjurman hwo 
where the one that initiaded this project publicly in 2001 and developed it up to version 1.1.6 in 2004. Without
