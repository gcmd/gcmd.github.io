<p>This page contains information about hacking and contributing to the Gnome Commander project. 
We encourage anyone hwo wants to contribute with code, translations, bugreporting, boil up 
new useful ideas, or just give some quality feedback that also is quite important. You are all welcome to 
sign up on our mailing lists and take part in discussions and development.</p>

<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>Some words about versions and version numbering.</p>
<p>Gnome Commander is being developed in a 
stable and a testing branch, where the test releases fills the purpose of testing new ideas. Successful ones 
will then get backported to the stable branch. The version numbers (major, minor and micro) follows the quite 
usual standard of odd and even versioning, where odd minor versions stands for the unstable releases and 
the even numbered branch eventually gets the thoroughly tested new functions backported. Remember this 
when talking about GCMD or when sending patches.</p>
<p>To check out the latest sources from SVN, following commands can be used:</p>

<p class="cntr">The stable 1.2 branch:<br>
<code>svn checkout svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-commander/trunk</code></p> 

<p class="cntr">The 1.3 testing branch:<br>
<code>svn checkout svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-commander/branches/gcmd-1-3</code></p> 


<h2><a name="contr">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>If you want to contribute, send in patches, translations, having some useful idea or just some feedback, 
good or bad, then you are welcome to contact us thrugh <a href="#maillists">our mailing lists</a> or 
<a href="#authors">the authors</a> directly if you want to keep it more private.</p>
<p>If you're not an programmer but have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program, check the 
<a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/trunk/TODO">TODO file</a> first before sending  
<a href="index.html#authors">email to the authors</a> or <a href="#maillists">the mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to submit a patch please do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email with the patch to the developers or the developer list.</li>
<li>Please use the -u flag when generating a patch.</li>
<li>Include it as text together with a good explanation of what the patch does or what problem/bug it solves.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="trnsl">Special note for translators:</a></h4>


<p>Although GNOME Commander is currently available in over 30 languages, there are still many missing 
and those to improve. The current status of all project translations can be found at
<a href="http://progress.gnome.org/module/gnome-commander">http://progress.gnome.org/module/gnome-commander</a>. </p>

<p>For adding a new translation simply download
<a href="http://progress.gnome.org/POT/gnome-commander.HEAD/po.HEAD.pot">the head potfile</a> 
and rename it to LL.po (replace "LL" with your language code, see the complete list of language codes).</p> 

<p>Here you will find the recipe on how to contribute your new or updated translation 
(replace "LL" with your language code, see the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#SEC221">complete list of language codes</a>). </p>
<ol>
<li>Get a fresh copy of the program source (either from SVN or snapshot)</li>
<li>Unpack it and run <code>./autogen.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Update proper LL.po file by usual chant: CD into the <code>po</code> directory 
and run <code>intltool-update LL</code>.</li>
</ol>
        
<p>You may find translation compedia to be quite handy as a reference. To create such a compedium 
from all LL GNOME translations it is required to:</p>

<pre>
wget -r -l1 -nd -A.po -b http://l10n-status.gnome.org/HEAD/LL/extras/
wget -r -l1 -nd -A.po -b http://l10n-status.gnome.org/HEAD/LL/office/
wget -r -l1 -nd -A.po -b http://l10n-status.gnome.org/HEAD/LL/fifth-toe/
msgcat -o compendium-LL.po *.po
</pre>

<p>Our recommended translation tools are: Poedit (<a href="http://www.poedit.org">http://www.poedit.org</a>/)
and gtranslator (<a href="http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net">http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net</a>/). KBabel could 
also be a good tool if you also have the neccesary KDE libs installed..</p>

<p>All translation files (LL.po) MUST be UTF-8 and to avoid corruption by
mail application please send them as gzipped or bzipped attachments.</p>

<p>Translators may also find <a href="http://www.open-tran.eu/index.html">the service Open-Tran.eu </a>useful 
(not only european languages). It offers an easy access to the translations of open source projects. It acts as a kind 
of a central Memory Translation database where you can look up a translation suggestion or submit a whole .po file 
to the server.</p>

<h2><a name="doc">Hacking documents</a></h2>
<p>Links to documents regarding Gnome Commander internals.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/trunk/doc/internal_viewer_hacking.txt">Internal-Viewer Internals</a>. 
This document describes details of the 'libgviewer' library, which implements GnomeCommander's Internal-Viewer. 
If you plan to hack the internal viewer, add features or just browse the source for fun, we recommend reading 
this document first (However note that <a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-commander/trunk/">the source files in SVN</a> 
always are more updated than this document).</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2><a name="build">Building from source</a></h2>
<h4>Required libraries:</h4>
<ul>
<li>GTK+2 (2.6.0) or above for latest version.</li>
<li>GnomeVFS (2.0) Used for most of the file handling. </li>
<li>Glib (2.0.0)</li>
<li>Gnome (2.0)</li>
<li>GnomeUI (2.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the libraries above, and of course their sub-dependencys, devel-packages and a sane build 
environment, the usual "./configure  make make install" procedure should work like a charm. If you are building 
the code checked out from SVN, use ./autogen.sh insted of configure, in the SVN case you also need to have 
the gnome-common files installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/index.html">FAM</a> is an optional library, it is used to 
monitoring file alterations, which means that when you create/delete/modify a file this program gets a message from 
FAM so it can update it's directory views on the fly.<br>
<strong>Update: from 0.9.8 and on, files modified within GC should update without FAM</strong>.</p>

<p>For the internal viewer to be able to show exif and IPTC data you also need to have 
<a href="http://libexif.sourceforge.net/">libexif</a> and <a href="http://libiptcdata.sourceforge.net/">libiptcdata</a> 
installed, this is optional though.</p>

<h4>Build on FreeBSD</h4>
<p>For our FreeBSD users here is a page describing 
<a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~reinholz/freebsd/apps_tools.html#gnomecommander">how 
to build GNOME Commander on FreeBSD</a> in order to get full functionality out of it.</p>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
<h3>Discovered a bug?</h3>
<p>You can report or view Gnome Commander bugs at 
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-commander" title="Please report bugs here">the 
gnome.org Bugzilla</a>.</p>

<p>Though Gnome Commander is relatively free from bugs and is a quite mature program, no programs will 
ever be totally bugfree. New bugs can be introduced with new features, or through other programs and 
libraries it depends on, this goes especially for development and testing versions. Quality bugreporting 
is very important and can be a very good help for the developers to make a better program. Bugreporting 
is not an act of dissatisfaction, so you are very welcome to help us find, hunt down and kill the bugs. 
Testing of new releases and bugreporting is the best way users without programming knowledge can help 
out in the development of a program, and those with programming knowledge are very welcome to suggest 
fixes and/or send patches to the developers, all in the spirit of free and open source software.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Contributors</h3>
<p>There are many small contributors that has contributed in many ways, it would be impossible to 
mention them all, but most of them contributing with code or translations are mentioned in the 
<a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/trunk/AUTHORS">AUTHORS file</a> or the 
<a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/trunk/po/ChangeLog">changelog of translations</a>.</p>

<p>A big "thanks to" is also directed to the former maintainer of Gnome Commander, Marcus Bjurman hwo 
where the one that initiaded this project publicly in 2001 and developed it up to version 1.1.6 in 2004. Without 
him there would not have been any Gnome Commander. Thank you Marcus.</p>
