<p>This page contains information about hacking and contributing to the GNOME Commander project.
We encourage anyone who wants to contribute with code, translations, bugreporting, boil up
new useful ideas, or just give some quality feedback that also is quite important. You are all welcome to
sign up on our mailing lists and take part in discussions and development.</p>

<h4>Branches and Versions</h4>
<p>GNOME Commander is being developed in several branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>master</em> branch, where all the normal development takes place;</li>
<li>a <em>stable</em> branch, named after the current stable release, which only
includes bugfixes, doc updates, translation updates, but no new features;</li>
<li>optionally, some <em>feature branches</em>, where new ideas or big features
are cooked until they are ready to be merged in the <em>master</em>
branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>The version numbers (major, minor and micro) follows the quite usual standard
of odd and even versioning. Even numbers are stable versions, that are intended for all-day use. 
Odd versions are development versions that are usually not available as package/binary executable. 
To use them, you have to compile them yourself. Remember this when talking about <abbr title="GNOME
Commander">GCMD</abbr> or when sending patches.</p>

<h4>Current plans</h4>
<p>In the master branch (<abbr title="GNOME Commander">GCMD</abbr> v1.3) the team behind 
<abbr title="GNOME Commander">GCMD</abbr> are now experimenting with python plugins that users can drop 
in the ~/.gnome-commander/plugins directory. The work on supporting meta-data also continues. The plan is 
to add this functionality to the searchtool, custom columns and the internal viewer. The 
<a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gnome-commander/plain/TODO">TODO file</a> gives a hint on what we are 
working on, or like to work on, and maybe appreciate some community efforts on. Users and developers are 
as usual welcome to contact us, ask questions and discuss the development on 
<a href="dev.html#maillists">our mailinglists</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="current">Git Repository</a></h2>

<p>The official Git repository of GNOME Commander is registered on 
<a href="https://git.gnome.org">git.gnome.org</a>. It was maintained by 
Piotr until the beginning of 2012. You can check it out by the following commands:</p>

<p class="cntr">The master branch:<br>
<code>git clone git://git.gnome.org/gnome-commander</code></p>

<p class="cntr">The current stable branch:<br>
<code>git clone -b gcmd-1-2-8 git://git.gnome.org/gnome-commander</code></p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-commander/">browse
the repository</a> in your web browser.</p>

<p>Gentoo users can also make use of the
<a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-commander/tree/data/gnome-commander.ebuild.in">ebuild
template in our source tree</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="contr">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>If you want to contribute, send in patches, translations, having some useful idea or just some feedback,
good or bad, then you are welcome to contact us thrugh <a href="#maillists">our mailing lists</a> or
<a href="#authors">the authors</a> directly if you want to keep it more private. If you plan to contribute 
by using git, we recommend to have a look in the 
<a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gnome-commander/plain/README.commits">README.commits</a> document.</p>
<p>If you're not an programmer but have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program, check the
<a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gnome-commander/plain/TODO">TODO file</a> first before sending
<a href="index.html#authors">email to the authors</a> or <a href="#maillists">the mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to submit a patch please do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email with the patch to the developers or the developer list.</li>
<li>Please use the -u flag when generating a patch.</li>
<li>Include it as text together with a good explanation of what the patch does or what problem/bug it solves.</li>
<li>You can also do all of that directly from Git using <code>git format-patch</code> and <code>git send-email</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="trnsl">Special note for translators:</a></h4>

<p>Although GNOME Commander is currently available in over 40 languages, there are still many missing
and those to improve. The current status of all project translations can be found at
<a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/module/gnome-commander/">https://l10n.gnome.org/module/gnome-commander/</a>. </p>

<p>For adding a new translation simply download the potfile(s) from that page
and rename it to LL.po (replace "LL" with your language code, see the complete list 
of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#Language-Codes">language codes</a>).</p>

<p>Here you will find the recipe on how to contribute your new or updated translation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a fresh copy of the program source (either from Git or snapshot)</li>
<li>Unpack it and run <code>./autogen.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Update proper LL.po file by usual chant: CD into the <code>po</code> directory
and run <code>intltool-update LL</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may find translation compedia to be quite handy as a reference. You can download some <code>po</code> files 
from other projects and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Creating-Compendia.html">create</a> 
such a compedium by:</p>

<pre>
msgcat -o compendium-LL.po *.po
</pre>

<p>There are several translation tools available. Some of them are: Poedit 
(<a href="http://www.poedit.net">http://www.poedit.net</a>/)
and gtranslator (<a href="http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net">http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net</a>/). 
KBabel could also be a good tool if you also have the neccesary KDE libs installed.</p>

<p>All translation files (LL.po) MUST be UTF-8 and to avoid corruption by
mail application please send them as gzipped or bzipped attachments.</p>

<p>Alternatively have look at <a href="http://l10n.gnome.org/">http://l10n.gnome.org/</a> if you want
to start translating for more projects than just GCMD.</p>

<p>Translators may also find <a href="http://www.open-tran.eu/index.html">the service Open-Tran.eu </a>useful,
(not only European languages). It offers an easy access to the translations of open source projects. It acts as a kind
of a central Memory Translation database where you can look up a translation suggestion or submit a whole .po file
to the server.</p>

<h2><a name="doc">Hacking documents</a></h2>
<p>Links to documents regarding GNOME Commander internals.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gnome-commander/plain/doc/internal_viewer_hacking.txt">Internal-Viewer Internals</a>.
This document describes details of the 'intviewer' library, which implements GNOME Commander's Internal-Viewer.
If you plan to hack the internal viewer, add features or just browse the source for fun, we recommend reading
this document first (However, note that <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-commander/tree/src/intviewer">the source files in Git</a>
always are more updated than this document).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="build">Building from source</a></h2>
<h4>Required libraries:</h4>
<ul>
<li>GTK+ (2.8.0) or above for latest version.</li>
<li>GnomeVFS (2.0) Used for most of the file handling. </li>
<li>Glib (2.6.0)</li>
<li>GNOME (2.0)</li>
<li>GnomeUI (2.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the libraries above, and of course their sub-dependencies, devel-packages and a sane build
environment, the usual "./configure make make install" procedure should work like a charm. If you are building
the code checked out from Git, use ./autogen.sh instead of configure, in the Git case you also need to have
the gnome-common files installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/index.html">FAM</a> is an optional library, it is used to
monitoring file alterations, which means that when you create/delete/modify a file this program gets a message from
FAM so it can update it's directory views on the fly.<br>
<strong>Update: since 0.9.8 and on, files modified within GNOME Commander should update without FAM</strong>.</p>

<h4>Build on FreeBSD</h4>
<p>For our FreeBSD users here is a page describing
<a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~reinholz/freebsd/apps_tools.html#gnomecommander">how
to build GNOME Commander on FreeBSD</a> in order to get full functionality out of it.</p>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
<h3>Discovered a bug?</h3>
<p>You can report or view GNOME Commander bugs at
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-commander" title="Please report bugs here">the
gnome.org Bugzilla</a>.</p>

<p>Though GNOME Commander is relatively free from bugs and is a quite mature program, no programs will
ever be totally bugfree. New bugs can be introduced with new features, or through other programs and
libraries it depends on, this goes especially for development and testing versions. Quality bug reporting
is very important and can be a very good help for the developers to make a better program. Bug reporting
is not an act of dissatisfaction, so you are very welcome to help us find, hunt down and kill the bugs.
Testing of new releases and bug reporting is the best way users without programming knowledge can help
out in the development of a program, and those with programming knowledge are very welcome to suggest
fixes and/or send patches to the developers, all in the spirit of free and open source software.</p>

<h2><a name="maillists">Mailing lists</a></h2>
<p>There are two mailing lists regarding GNOME Commander.</p>
<p>The user list is mostly for topics about using GNOME Commander, a kind of support list.
The devel list is where the developers of this project are discussing topics about the development.
For the moment, all posts from non members of these lists are beeing held for approval due to
spam reasons, but anyone are welcome to sign up on the lists and post unmoderated. So, if you
post without beeing signed up on the list, your mail will be moderated before it is sent to the list,
and remember that you should make a note in the email that people should CC their replies to you
if you not are on the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user list: <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-users">gcmd-users</a> (gcmd-users at nongnu.org)</li>
<li>The developer list: <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-devel">gcmd-devel</a> (gcmd-devel at nongnu.org)</li>
