<p>This page contains information about hacking and contributing to the GNOME Commander project.
We encourage anyone who wants to contribute with code, translations, bugreporting, boil up
new useful ideas, or just give some quality feedback that also is quite important. You are all welcome to
sign up on our mailing lists and take part in discussions and development.</p>

<h3>Versions</h3>
<p>Some words about versions and version numbering.</p>
<p>GNOME Commander is being developed in a
stable and a testing branch, where the test releases fills the purpose of testing new ideas. Successful ones
will then get backported to the stable branch. The version numbers (major, minor and micro) follows the quite
usual standard of odd and even versioning, where odd minor versions stands for the unstable releases and
the even numbered branch eventually gets the thoroughly tested new functions backported. Remember this
when talking about <abbr title="GNOME Commander">GCMD</abbr> or when sending patches.</p>
<p>To check out the latest sources from SVN, following commands can be used:</p>

<p class="cntr">The stable 1.2 branch:<br>
<code>svn checkout svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-commander/trunk</code></p>

<p class="cntr">The 1.3 testing branch:<br>
<code>svn checkout svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-commander/branches/gcmd-1-3</code></p>

<p>Gentoo users can also make use of the
<a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-commander/branches/gcmd-1-3/data/gnome-commander.ebuild?view=markup">
ebuild in our source tree</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="contr">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>If you want to contribute, send in patches, translations, having some useful idea or just some feedback,
good or bad, then you are welcome to contact us thrugh <a href="#maillists">our mailing lists</a> or
<a href="#authors">the authors</a> directly if you want to keep it more private.</p>
<p>If you're not an programmer but have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program, check the
<a href="http://gcmd.rootnode.net/trunk/TODO">TODO file</a> first before sending
<a href="index.html#authors">email to the authors</a> or <a href="#maillists">the mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to submit a patch please do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email with the patch to the developers or the developer list.</li>
<li>Please use the -u flag when generating a patch.</li>
<li>Include it as text together with a good explanation of what the patch does or what problem/bug it solves.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="trnsl">Special note for translators:</a></h4>


<p>Although GNOME Commander is currently available in over 30 languages, there are still many missing
and those to improve. The current status of all project translations can be found at
<a href="http://progress.gnome.org/module/gnome-commander">http://progress.gnome.org/module/gnome-commander</a>. </p>

<p>For adding a new translation simply download
<a href="http://progress.gnome.org/POT/gnome-commander.HEAD/po.HEAD.pot">the head potfile</a>
and rename it to LL.po (replace "LL" with your language code, see the complete list of language codes).</p>

<p>Here you will find the recipe on how to contribute your new or updated translation
(replace "LL" with your language code, see the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_15.html#SEC221">complete list of language codes</a>). </p>
<ol>
<li>Get a fresh copy of the program source (either from SVN or snapshot)</li>
<li>Unpack it and run <code>./autogen.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Update proper LL.po file by usual chant: CD into the <code>po</code> directory
and run <code>intltool-update LL</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may find translation compedia to be quite handy as a reference. To create such a compedium
from all LL GNOME translations it is required to:</p>

<pre>
wget -r -l1 -nd -A.po -b http://l10n-status.gnome.org/HEAD/LL/extras/
wget -r -l1 -nd -A.po -b http://l10n-status.gnome.org/HEAD/LL/office/
wget -r -l1 -nd -A.po -b http://l10n-status.gnome.org/HEAD/LL/fifth-toe/
msgcat -o compendium-LL.po *.po
</pre>

<p>Our recommended translation tools are: Poedit (<a href="http://www.poedit.org">http://www.poedit.org</a>/)
and gtranslator (<a href="http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net">http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net</a>/). KBabel could
also be a good tool if you also have the neccesary KDE libs installed..</p>

<p>All translation files (LL.po) MUST be UTF-8 and to avoid corruption by
mail application please send them as gzipped or bzipped attachments.</p>

<p>Translators may also find <a href="http://www.open-tran.eu/index.html">the service Open-Tran.eu </a>useful
(not only european languages). It offers an easy access to the translations of open source projects. It acts as a kind
of a central Memory Translation database where you can look up a translation suggestion or submit a whole .po file
to the server.</p>

<h2><a name="doc">Hacking documents</a></h2>
<p>Links to documents regarding GNOME Commander internals.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gcmd.rootnode.net/trunk/doc/internal_viewer_hacking.txt">Internal-Viewer Internals</a>.
This document describes details of the 'intgviewer' library, which implements GNOME Commander's Internal-Viewer.
If you plan to hack the internal viewer, add features or just browse the source for fun, we recommend reading
this document first (However, note that <a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-commander/trunk/">the source files in SVN</a>
always are more updated than this document).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="build">Building from source</a></h2>
<h4>Required libraries:</h4>
<ul>
<li>GTK+ (2.8.0) or above for latest version.</li>
<li>GnomeVFS (2.0) Used for most of the file handling. </li>
<li>Glib (2.6.0)</li>
<li>GNOME (2.0)</li>
<li>GnomeUI (2.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the libraries above, and of course their sub-dependencies, devel-packages and a sane build
environment, the usual "./configure make make install" procedure should work like a charm. If you are building
the code checked out from SVN, use ./autogen.sh instead of configure, in the SVN case you also need to have
the gnome-common files installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/index.html">FAM</a> is an optional library, it is used to
monitoring file alterations, which means that when you create/delete/modify a file this program gets a message from
FAM so it can update it's directory views on the fly.<br>
<strong>Update: since 0.9.8 and on, files modified within GNOME Commander should update without FAM</strong>.</p>

<p>For the internal viewer to be able to show exif and IPTC data you also need to have
<a href="http://libexif.sourceforge.net/">libexif</a> and <a href="http://libiptcdata.sourceforge.net/">libiptcdata</a>
installed, this is optional though.</p>

<h4>Build on FreeBSD</h4>
<p>For our FreeBSD users here is a page describing
<a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~reinholz/freebsd/apps_tools.html#gnomecommander">how
to build GNOME Commander on FreeBSD</a> in order to get full functionality out of it.</p>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
<h3>Discovered a bug?</h3>
<p>You can report or view GNOME Commander bugs at
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-commander" title="Please report bugs here">the
gnome.org Bugzilla</a>.</p>

<p>Though GNOME Commander is relatively free from bugs and is a quite mature program, no programs will
ever be totally bugfree. New bugs can be introduced with new features, or through other programs and
libraries it depends on, this goes especially for development and testing versions. Quality bug reporting
is very important and can be a very good help for the developers to make a better program. Bug reporting
is not an act of dissatisfaction, so you are very welcome to help us find, hunt down and kill the bugs.
Testing of new releases and bug reporting is the best way users without programming knowledge can help
out in the development of a program, and those with programming knowledge are very welcome to suggest
fixes and/or send patches to the developers, all in the spirit of free and open source software.</p>

<h2><a name="maillists">Mailing lists</a></h2>
<p>There are two mailing lists regarding GNOME Commander.</p>
<p>The user list is mostly for topics about using GNOME Commander, a kind of support list.
The devel list is where the developers of this project are discussing topics about the development.
For the moment, all posts from non members of these lists are beeing held for approval due to
spam reasons, but anyone are welcome to sign up on the lists and post unmoderated. So, if you
post without beeing signed up on the list, your mail will be moderated before it is sent to the list,
and remember that you should make a note in the email that people should CC their replies to you
if you not are on the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>The user list: <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-users">gcmd-users</a> (gcmd-users at nongnu.org)</li>
<li>The developer list: <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcmd-devel">gcmd-devel</a> (gcmd-devel at nongnu.org)</li>
