<h3>File managers For Linux</h3>
<p>An article at <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux.com</a> by Michael M. Murphree, testing, comparing and 
reviewing a lot of different filemanagers for Linux systems. About Gnome Commander he writes:</p>
<p><blockquote>GNOME Commander offers a much smaller footprint and a more polished GUI than do FileRunner and gentoo. 
It provides the more typical tool bar and menu system, in addition to mapping buttons to each function key. It 
also provides a command history, capacity for multiple predefined FTP sessions, and file search. The most 
interesting feature that I found was the advanced rename tool, which allows you to quickly rename multiple 
files using regular expressions, counters, and case matching. I was disappointed that the user manual did not 
install properly, particularly since key combinations did not match those for Midnight Commander. It still struck 
me a a compact, polished file manager, especially suitable for those running the GNOME desktop.</blockquote></p>
