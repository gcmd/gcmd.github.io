<h2 class="htwo"><a name="bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
<h3>Discovered a bug?</h3>
<p>You can report or view Gnome Commander bugs at 
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=gnome-commander" title="Please report bugs here">the 
gnome.org Bugzilla</a>.</p>

<p>Though Gnome Commander is relatively free from bugs and a quite mature program, no programs will 
ever be totally bugfree, new bugs can be introduced with new features or through other programs and 
libraries it depends on, this goes especially for development and testing versions. Good bugreporting 
is very important and can be a very good help for the developers to make a better program. Bugreporting 
is not an act of dissatisfaction, so you are very welcome to help us hunt down and kill the bugs. 
Testing of new releases and bugreporting is the best way users without programming knowledge can help 
out in the development of a program, and those with programming knowledge are welcome to suggest fixes 
and/or send patches to the developers, all in the spirit of free and open source software.</p>
