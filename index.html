<img class="info" src="img/cross.png" width="30" height="42" alt=""> Piotr Eljasiak</h4>
<p>It is very sad for us to announce that Piotr Eljasiak, the project                                  
manager and main developer of GNOME Commander 
<a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/gcmd-devel/2013-04/msg00000.html">passed away</a>
in the beginning of 2012. Without him GNOME Commander would not be what it is today.</p>
                                                                                                    
<p>Piotr took over the project from Marcus Bjurman in 2006 together with                               
Assaf Gordon at version 1.1.6. Until version 1.2.8.15, Piotr implemented                            
many new features and pushed it to one of the best graphical two pane                               
file managers in the Linux environment.</p>                                                    
                                                                                                    
<p>Piotr had many ideas about the future of GNOME Commander. Some of them are 
already implemented and are waiting to be released in version 1.4. We are 
convinced that Piotr would like to see his work go on.</p>
