<img class="info" src="img/cross.png" width="30" height="42" alt=""> Piotr Eljasiak</h4>
<p>It is very sad for us to announce that Piotr Eljasiak, the project                                  
manager and main developer of GNOME Commander passed away in the                                    
beginning of 2012. Without him GNOME Commander would not be what it 
is today.</p>
                                                                                                    
<p>Piotr took over the project from Marcus Bjurman in 2006 together with                               
Assaf Gordon at version 1.1.6. Until version 1.2.8.15, Piotr implemented                            
many new features and pushed it to one of the best graphical two pane                               
file managers in the Linux environment.</p>                                                    
                                                                                                    
<p>Piotr had many ideas about the future of GNOME Commander. Some of them are 
already implemented and are waiting to be released in version 1.4. We are 
convinced that Piotr would like to see his work go on.</p>

<h4>The unstable 1.3 branch.</h4>
<p>In the unstable branch the team behind <abbr title="GNOME Commander">GCMD</abbr> are now experimenting with python plugins
that users can drop in the ~/.gnome-commander/plugins directory. The work on supporting
meta-data also continues. The plan is to add this functionality to the searchtool, custom columns and the internal viewer.
The <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gnome-commander/plain/TODO">TODO file</a>
gives a hint on what we are working on, or like to work on, and maybe appreciate some community efforts on.
Users and developers are as usual welcome to contact us, ask questions and discuss the development
on <a href="dev.html#maillists">our mailinglists</a>.</p>
