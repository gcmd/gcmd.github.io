<h4 class="nh4">GCMD goes C++ - Feb. 26 2007</h4>
<p>The Gnome Commander code has now begun a migration from C to C++. Both the HEAD and 1.3 devel branch are 
now initially migrated and seemes to be working quite allright. Seen from a user perspective this migration is not supposed 
to change anything, the change is done due to coding reasons. Tests and bugreports on the 
<a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-commander/">GCMD SVN code</a> are of course, as usual, much appreciated. 
Further info on how to download the source from SVN  can be found on our <a href="dev.html">Development page</a>, 
but remember that this unreleased SVN code is to be considered unstable and only for testing purposes.</p>


<h4 class="nh4">GCMD in Fedora - Jan. 03 2007</h4>
<p>Gnome Commander has now found its way into <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/extras/">the Fedora "Extras" repositry</a>.  
Users of Fedora 5 and 6 has now got convienient official binary Fedora packages to install from, available for the architechtures i386, 
x86_64 and ppc. The authors of Gnome Commander thanks the team behind Fedora, and wish them a happy 2007.</p>


<h4 class="nh4">New release, version 1.2.3 - Dec. 12 2006</h4>
<p>Fastest new release so far ... This is a bug fix to the problem introduced in the yeasterday release 1.2.2. Please
upgrade to this latest one where this bug <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384752">384752 
- Permissions for new dirs</a> is fixed (we hope that not too many of you had time to upgrade to 1.2.2, sorry for the 
inconvenience).</p>


<h4>The unstable 1.3 branch.</h4>
<p>In the unstable branch the team behind GCMD are now experimenting with python plugins 
that users can drop in the ~/.gnome-commander/plugins directory. The work on supporting
meta-data also continues. The plan is to add this functionality to the searchtool, custom columns and the internal viewer. 
The <a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnome-commander/trunk/TODO">TODO file</a> 
gives a hint on what we are working on, or like to work on, and maybe appreciate some community efforts on. 
Users and developers are as usual welcome to contact us, ask questions and discuss the development 
on <a href="dev.html#maillists">our mailinglists</a>.</p>
