<p>This page contains some very simple tips and tricks on using and getting the most out of Gnome Commander.</p>


<h3><a name="archives">Handling archives</a></h3>
<p><abbr title="Gnome Commander">GCMD</abbr> still lacks built in browsing of compressed archives. 
However the program can be configured so that working with archives becomes quite practical anyway. 
This is how you do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you dont already have the program <a href="http://fileroller.sourceforge.net/">Fileroller</a>, 
download it and install it.</li>
<li>Open the options dialog and go to the <i>Programs</i>  tab.</li>
<li>Add two favorite apps using the values shown <a href="tips_images/create_archive.png">here</a> 
and <a href="tips_images/extract_archive.png">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now right click any file or folder and choose <i>Create archive...</i> to compress it and 
right click compressed files and choose <i>Extract archive...</i> to extract it.</p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="removable">Using removable devices</a></h3>
<p>If you use removable devices such as cd's, floppies and cameras a 
lot you can make GC automaticly take care of mounting them by following this 
guide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the options dialog and go to the <i>Devices</i> tab.</li>
<li><a href="tips_images/dev_cd.png">Add the devices that you are using</a>. 
This is <a href="tips_images/mounting.png">how the program looks with a few added 
devices</a>. In the last image the red circle shows the available devices, there is also a button, 
in the green circle, to press if we want to unmount the floppy, which happened to be mounted. 
The icons that are used for the devices in the example should be available in the 
<i>$(prefix)/share/pixmaps/gnome-commander/device-icons</i> folder on your computer.</li>
<li>There is also an option to skip mounting in the <a href="ss/opt_dev.png">option device tab</a>, 
this can be useful for making shortcuts to directories, or if you have some automounting 
feature that mounts it at its mountpoint when available, or if you use Supermount that does 
it on access basis.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3><a name="icon">Using a nice nautilus icon theme</a></h3>
<p class="warning">This is outdated info since Nautilus and later Gnome versions no longer uses these kind of themes.</p>
<p>The default icon theme that comes with GC lacks icons for a lot of 
file types and only looks good at icon size 16. There are other themes around 
though, that are more complete and looks better in bigger sizes. Unscalable 
Gorilla by Jimmac is one example and can be used in GC by following theese 
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the theme.</li>
<li>Unpack the theme to whereever you want.</li>
<li>Start GC and open the options dialog. In the<i> Layout</i> tab set the <i>Theme icon directory</i> 
to be the folder where you extracted Unscalable Gorilla. Also change <i>Row height</i> and <i>Icon size</i> 
to 20 or some other size that you like. When you're done also make sure that the <i>Graphical mode</i> 
is set to <i>MIME icons</i>.</li>
<li>When you now close the options dialog the file lisings should refresh 
and you should see Unscalable Gorilla being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide should work for all other nautilus icon themes as well.</p>

<h3><a name="sh">Open a full terminal</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you want a quick way of opening a full teminal window with the current directory as 
the terminals working directory. Well, that is easy, just type <code>&nbsp;sh&nbsp;</code>, or 
maybe <code>&nbsp;bash&nbsp;</code> if you prefer, in the <abbr title="Gnome Commander">GCMD</abbr> 
command line and hit SHIFT ENTER - there you have it.</p>
<hr>


<p>Ok, that is all for now.</p>
