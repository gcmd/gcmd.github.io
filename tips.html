 <big><b><big>Tips and tricks for Gnome Commander</big></b><br>
 <br>
 1. Using a nice nautilus icon theme<br>
 <small>The default icon theme that comes with GC lacks icons for a lot of 
file types and only looks good at icon size 16. There are other themes around 
though that are more complete and looks better in bigger sizes. Unscalable 
Gorilla by Jimmac is a good example and can be used in GC by following theese 
steps:<br>
 <br>
 </small></big> 
<ul>
   <li>Download Unscaleable Gorilla from <a
 href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/download.php3?id=29">here.</a></li>
   <li>Unpack the theme to whereever you want.</li>
   <li>Start GC and open the options dialog. In the<i> Layout</i> tab set
the <i>Theme icon directory</i> to be the folder where you extracted Unscaleable
Gorilla. Also change <i>Row height</i> and <i>Icon size</i> to 20 or some
other size that you like. When you're done also make sure that the <i>Graphical
mode</i> is set to <i>MIME icons</i>.</li>
   <li>When you now close the options dialog the file lisings should refresh 
and you should see Unscaleable Gorilla being used.</li>
 
</ul>
 This guide should work for all other nautilus icon themes as well.<br>
 <br>

 2. Handling archives<br>
 <small>GC still lacks built in browsing of compressed archives. However
the program can be configured so that working with archives becomes quite
practical anyway. This is how you do it:<br>
 <br>
 </small></big> 
<ul>
   <li>If you dont already have the program <a
 href="http://fileroller.sourceforge.net/">Fileroller</a>, download it and 
install it.</li>
   <li>Open the options dialog and go to the <i>Programs</i> tab.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Add two favorite apps using the values shown <a
 href="tips_images/create_archive.png">here</a> and <a
 href="tips_images/extract_archive.png">here</a>.</li>
 
</ul>
 You can now right click any file or folder and choose <i>Create archive...</i> 
to compress it and right click compressed files and choose <i>Extract archive...</i> 
to extract it.<br>
 <br>
 <big><br>
 3. Using removable devices<br>
 <small>If you use removable devices such as cd's, floppies and cameras a 
lot you can make GC automaticly take care of mounting them by following this 
guide:<br>
 <br>
 </small></big> 
<ul>
   <li>Open the options dialog and go to the <i>Devices</i> tab.</li>
   <li>Add the devices that you are using.&nbsp;<a
 href="tips_images/dev_cd.png">This</a> is how I have added my scsi cdrom.&nbsp;<a
 href="tips_images/mounting.png">This</a> is how the program looks with a 
few added devices. In the last image circle A shows the available devices 
and circle B shows the button to press if we want to unmount the floppy,
which happened to be mounted. The icons that are used for the devices in
the example should be available in the <i>$(prefix)/share/pixmaps/gnome-commander/device-icons</i> 
folder on your computer.</li>
 
</ul>
 <br>
